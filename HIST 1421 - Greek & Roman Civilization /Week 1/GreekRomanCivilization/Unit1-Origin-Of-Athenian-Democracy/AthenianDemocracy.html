    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Stone, Slate, Muted Blue-Gray) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, multi-section single-page application. The structure uses a top-level navigation to guide users through key concepts: a Timeline for historical context, The People for demographics, Pillars of Democracy to detail government bodies, and Holding Power Accountable for control mechanisms. This non-linear, exploratory structure is chosen over a direct report-to-page conversion to enhance user engagement and understanding by grouping related concepts interactively, rather than following the original academic text flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Population: (Goal: Inform/Compare) -> Donut Chart (Chart.js) -> Interactive tooltips -> Justification: Visually striking way to show the small proportion of enfranchised citizens. 2. Constitutional History: (Goal: Change) -> Interactive Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Click to reveal details -> Justification: Effectively shows the evolution of democracy over time. 3. Government Bodies: (Goal: Organize) -> Interactive Cards (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Click to expand -> Justification: Breaks down complex institutions into digestible, user-initiated chunks, preventing information overload. 4. Control Mechanisms: (Goal: Organize) -> HTML/CSS Process Flow Diagram -> Hover/Click for details -> Justification: Visualizes the sequence and relationship between different forms of accountability. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
