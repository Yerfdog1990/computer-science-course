    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The webpage is structured thematically. It begins with a general introduction, followed by dedicated sections for each key philosopher (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). Each philosopher's section uses an expandable card design to allow users to dive deeper into their specific arguments and criticisms. A subsequent section consolidates recurring themes across their philosophies, also using expandable cards. The page concludes with a reflection on their legacy and the evolving nature of democracy. This structure is chosen to facilitate clear segregation of complex philosophical ideas, enable progressive disclosure of detailed information, and enhance user understanding through a logical flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The content is primarily textual and analytical. Expandable content sections are used extensively to manage information density and provide user-driven detail access. Unicode characters are used for subtle visual cues and icons (e.g., lightbulb for themes) to meet the 'no SVG' requirement while maintaining visual interest. No charts are included as the source report does not contain quantitative data suitable for charting; the focus is entirely on qualitative insights and philosophical arguments. -->

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Socrates (470-399 BCE): The Critic Who Paid the Price 🗣️</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Socrates was a vocal critic of democracy, and his trial and death in the People's Court became a stark testament to what he saw as its inherent flaws.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-card p-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <p class="text-slate-700">Socrates was accused of "corrupting the youth of Athens" and practicing impiety, leading to his trial at the People's Court. In a narrow public vote, Athenians sentenced him to death by poison. This event, chronicled in Plato's Apology, became a key example for critics of democracy.</p>

                <p class="text-slate-700">Socrates' quest to verify the Oracle of Delphi's pronouncement that he was the wisest man led him to question Athens' prominent politicians, poets, and artisans. He found that these seemingly wise men refused to acknowledge their own ignorance, leading him to conclude his own consciousness of ignorance made him truly wise. This, however, deeply insulted powerful Athenians and contributed to his downfall.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">Mob Rule and Uninformed Judgment</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">Socrates criticized democracy's inability to ensure governance by the educated and trained. He believed that "voting in an election is a skill, not a random intuition." His trial exemplified his fear of "demagoguery," where skilled politicians could sway an uninformed public to make disastrous decisions, effectively turning justice into "mob-rule." The one-day trial where a large audience of people served as "judges" lacking legal knowledge was, in hindsight, seen as an egregious act.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Plato (428/427-348/347 BCE): Freedom's Dangerous Excess ⛓️</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Deeply impacted by his mentor Socrates' fate, Plato viewed democracy as a system prone to excess freedom, ultimately leading to tyranny.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-card p-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <p class="text-slate-700">In his work, *Republic* (Book VIII), Plato's character Socrates argues that democracy, while offering great freedom, can lead to its own downfall. People's increasing demand for liberty can reach an extreme where any perceived infringement is protested, turning freedom into a path to slavery.</p>
            <button class="toggle-btn mt-4" data-target="plato-details">Learn More <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-5 w-5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.293 7.293a1 1 0 011.414 0L10 10.586l3.293-3.293a1 1 0 111.414 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414z" clip-rule="evenodd" /></svg></button>

                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">Democracy's Cycle to Tyranny</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">Plato theorized that the "excess of liberty... seems only to pass into excess of slavery." As citizens pursue absolute freedom, they become intolerant of any authority or structure. This extreme desire for freedom, paradoxically, makes them vulnerable to a leader who promises to restore their freedoms.</p>
                <p class="text-slate-700 italic mt-2">
                    <strong class="text-blue-700">Practical Example:</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, some people protested temporary measures like wearing face masks, viewing them as an infringement on personal freedom. While such protests can sometimes serve as a vital check on government power, Plato might caution that an extreme reaction to perceived infringements, even those designed for public safety, can become excessive. This echoes his concern that the pursuit of unlimited freedom might ironically pave the way for a strong leader promising to restore that freedom, potentially leading to tyranny.
                </p>
                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">The Rise of the Tyrant</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">This excessive freedom paves the way for a "tyrant." Such a figure emerges as a "champion of the poor," blaming the rich and consolidating power. To maintain stability, the tyrant surrounds himself with loyalists and eliminates those he cannot control, including the wealthy and intellectuals. For Plato, democracy's susceptibility to demagoguery and its governance by the "uneducated and untrained" were significant weaknesses that could lead to authoritarian rule.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Aristotle (384-322 BCE): The Golden Mean & Evolving Governance 🌱</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Aristotle offered a more nuanced view, emphasizing the need for balance and a 'golden mean' in democracy, recognizing its dynamic nature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-card p-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <p class="text-slate-700">Aristotle, unlike his predecessors, viewed democracy as a "natural governance order" given that the majority of people are often poor and would demand equality. However, he stressed the importance of finding a "golden mean" to balance freedom, ensuring it is neither too modest nor too excessive. Citizens should be capable of both governing and obeying as freemen.</p>

                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">Different Democracies and Continuous Development</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">Aristotle acknowledged that there were different forms of democracy, implying that democracy is not static but capable of continuous development. This perspective highlights democracy as a "work in progress," reflecting the challenges of a given historical moment.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">Risks and Democratic Education</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">While seeing democracy as natural, Aristotle also warned of its risks. He believed that a direct democracy dominated by the poor could lead to tyranny. To avoid this, he stressed that "democratic citizens need to receive a democratic education, an education relative to the regime."</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-slate-800">Purpose of Political Life</h4>
                <p class="text-slate-700">For Aristotle, the ultimate purpose of political life and the state is to create an environment where people can achieve happiness, not merely to serve the interests of a single group (rich or poor). This goal is best achieved through the establishment of a robust rule of law.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900">Legacy and the Evolving Nature of Democracy 🔄</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-4xl mx-auto">The insights of these Greek philosophers form foundational layers of democratic thought. Their critiques, though thorough, were shaped by their context and highlight the continuous evolution of democracy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-card p-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-left space-y-3">
            <p class="text-slate-700">It is crucial to remember that these philosophers, including Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, originated from privileged backgrounds. Their observations of Athenian democracy's successes and failures were insightful but also subject to human limitations and their specific historical context. For instance, Aristotle himself tutored Alexander the Great, placing him far from the "demos" he often discussed.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">The understanding and practice of democracy are not automatically inherited; each new individual and generation must learn and apply these lessons from scratch. Just as philosophical thoughts evolve over time, so too does democracy itself. It is not a fixed concept but a developing one, requiring continuous effort, refinement, and adaptation to the challenges of each historical moment.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">Despite its perceived failures and limitations in Ancient Greece, democracy represented a significant innovation in governance: extending power, at least partially, to the less privileged. This enduring concept continues to evolve, pushing the boundaries of political participation far beyond what the ancient Athenians could have imagined.</p>
