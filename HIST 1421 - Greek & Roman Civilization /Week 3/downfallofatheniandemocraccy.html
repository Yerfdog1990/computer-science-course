        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>Two and a half millennia ago, Athens was the hegemon of the Mediterranean, economically, politically, and culturally dominant among the more than 50 independent city-states of classical Greece. This rise was due to its reliance on a form of popular government called "democracy" and its defeat of the Persian military at the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. However, Athens' bright star was short-lived, and its decline, chronicled by Thucydides and Xenophon, offers salutary lessons to modern Western heirs, especially the United States.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Flowering</h3>
            <p>Athens was not always the city of philosophers and playwrights. Its exact origins are unknown, but legend states it was propelled to power by the hero Theseus, shaking off Crete's yoke prior to 1,000 B.C. During the Greek Bronze Age, Greece was a monarchy. After a mysterious dark age, Greece fragmented into many city-states. The first major cultural flowering appears to have been in Ionia, with pioneering minds like Thales ("father of science") and Pythagoras in Miletus.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example of Early Cultural Influence:</strong><br>
                The Ionian city of Miletus, home to Thales and Pythagoras, served as an early Greek center of learning and culture, demonstrating the intellectual vibrancy that preceded Athens' peak.
            </div>
            <p>Miletus's glory ended with the rise of the Achaemenid Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great and Darius. Persia conquered all of Asia Minor, including Ionian Greek city-states. Athens, an ally of Ionian states, sent continual aid and encouraged armed uprisings against Persia, even sacking and burning the Persian capital of Sardis. This provoked Darius to assemble a large invasion force to reduce Athens to ruins.</p>

            <span class="section-title-icon">⚔️</span> Battle of Marathon: Free Men vs. Subjects
        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>In 490 B.C., the Persian armada landed near Marathon. The Athenians, with their sole ally the Plataeans, led by Miltiades, prepared to fight. Despite being outnumbered and outclassed by the professional Persian shock troops (the Immortals, supposedly numbering 10,000), the mostly civilian Athenian soldiers, lightly armed and untrained, decided on an unconventional attack.</p>

            <p>According to Herodotus, the Athenians ran barefoot across the plains of Marathon in a sudden onslaught, surprising the Persians. They encircled and defeated the Persians, with many Athenians displaying extraordinary valor, fighting even with severed limbs. News of the victory reached Athens first via a runner who ran 26 miles nonstop, collapsing and dying after uttering "Nenikekamen!" ("We have won!"). Upon arrival, the Persians found Athens ready and retreated across the Aegean.</p>

            <p>The Battle of Marathon is often considered the starting point of Western civilization, with John Stuart Mill proclaiming its importance to English history. Herodotus attributed the improbable Athenian victory to their love of <strong>freedom</strong>, contrasting it with the mechanical servitude of the Persians. The Athenians were free men, unwilling to submit to an imperial master, making freedom a greater force than any military of despots.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example of Freedom's Power:</strong><br>
                The Battle of Marathon (490 B.C.) vividly illustrates the power of free men fighting for liberty against a larger, professional invading force. Athenian citizen-soldiers, despite being outnumbered and less trained than the Persian Immortals (numbering 10,000), fought with extraordinary valor and tenacity, demonstrating that a love of freedom can be a greater force than military might.

    <!-- Athenian Democracy: Origins and Structure -->
    <details>
        <summary class="text-2xl">
            <span class="section-title-icon">🏛️</span> Athenian Democracy: Origins and Structure
        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>Athenian freedom stemmed from democracy, an idea widespread in classical Greece. The father of Athenian democracy was <strong>Solon</strong>, a statesman and lawgiver who designed a government to represent the will of the people, allowing all Athenian male citizens to participate. Initially, Athens was governed by an archon and the oligarchic Areopagus council, under the rigid code of Draco.</p>

            <p>Solon overturned the power of the archon and Areopagus but failed to institute stable democracy, leading to the tyranny of Pisistratus and his son. However, the tyranny was overthrown, and Athenian democracy was restored and rejuvenated under <strong>Cleisthenes</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Structure of Athenian Government:</h3>
            <p>While not a "pure" democracy, it was highly popular:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Ekklesia (Assembly):</strong> The chief governing body, consisting of up to 6,000 members (5-10% of eligible male citizens). It voted on legislation.</li>
                <li><strong>Boule (Council of 500):</strong> A smaller body that proposed legislation to the Ekklesia.</li>
                <li><strong>Heliala (Popular Tribunal):</strong> An enormous court of another 6,000 Athenian citizens, with power to preside over cases and "legislate from the bench."</li>
                <li><strong>Areopagus and Archon:</strong> Maintained for primarily ceremonial functions, though the Areopagus adjudicated homicide cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This robust popular government meant politics and governance were central to every Athenian. However, the large size of most branches made measured deliberation impossible, leading to instability and vulnerability to ambitious demagogues and oligarchic attempts to restore old forms. This openness, while attracting idealists, ultimately contributed to Athens' demise.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example of Democratic Instability:</strong><br>
                The Athenian Ekklesia, with up to 6,000 members, and the Heliala, also with 6,000 citizens, were so populous that measured deliberation was impossible. This made the government unstable and prone to manipulation by demagogues like Pericles and Alcibiades, who could sway large crowds, leading to impulsive or self-serving decisions.

    <details>
        <summary class="text-2xl">
            <span class="section-title-icon">🛡️</span> Athens vs. Sparta
        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>Athens' great rival was Sparta, a peculiar city-state that was part republic, part military dictatorship, and part proto-communist Utopia. Sparta was unique for its extraordinary longevity despite being a repressive state, prioritizing order, stability, and rigid civic virtue under its lawgiver <strong>Lycurgus</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Spartan Society and Government:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Lycurgus's Code:</strong> Imposed strict rules to stamp out luxury. Spartans wore simple clothing and lived communally.</li>
                <li><strong>Military Training:</strong> All Spartan males were removed from parents as boys for years of harsh military training.</li>
                <li><strong>Helots:</strong> Agricultural and other labor was performed by non-Spartan subordinates, similar to slaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Spartans were prohibited from owning gold/silver (money was iron) and from engaging in trade/manufacturing.</li>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> Essentially oligarchical, with two kings and two small legislative councils (Ephorate and Gerousia), chosen from the power elite.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sparta's longevity and rigid structure prompted admiration, even among Athenian intellectuals. Its collectivist absolutism appealed to those seeking a cure for human frailty, drawing admiration from figures like Hitler and the modern Chinese Communist Party (which promotes Spartan values like abstemious living, fitness, and militarism through events like Spartan races).</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example of Spartan Longevity and Values:</strong><br>
                Machiavelli observed that Sparta maintained itself for a long period due to its thinly inhabited country, prohibition of foreign immigration, and Lycurgus's laws establishing great equality in property but less in rank, leading to equal poverty and less ambition among the commons. This allowed citizens to continue long in unity. This rigid, militarized, and insular regime served as a foil to Athenian liberty.
            </div>

            <p>Sparta, an impoverished but militarized hermit regime, was a foil for Athenian liberty. It assembled an alliance of Greek city-states (e.g., Corinth, Thebes) against Athenian power. Despite rivalries, Spartans were Greeks first; they joined Athens against external threats. Sparta missed Marathon by a day but praised the Athenian victory. A decade later, 300 elite Spartan soldiers, including King Leonidas, along with allies, delayed the huge Persian army at Thermopylae, a suicide mission allowing Greece to mobilize defenses, similar to Soviet valor at Stalingrad.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, Sparta's isolation and cultural superiority, combined with its destabilizing allure to some Athenian elites, led to the Peloponnesian War.</p>

        <summary class="text-2xl">
            <span class="section-title-icon">🏆</span> The Golden Age & Peloponnesian War
        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>The Peloponnesian War was incited by Athens, at the behest of <strong>Pericles</strong>, a demagogue who rose to power in the mid-fifth century B.C. during Athens' short-lived Golden Age. After the final victory over the Persians in 478 B.C., made possible by the Delian League, Athens transformed the League into an empire, exploiting weaker allies. Athens itself prospered, producing immense talent.</p>

            <h3>Periclean Period and the War's Outset:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Pericles' Rise:</strong> As a presiding military general (strategos), Pericles led the radical democratic faction. He curried favor by bribing citizens with public money, draining the treasury for lavish public works and military expeditions against subject-states like Thebes and Miletus.</li>
                <li><strong>Antagonism:</strong> His big-spending and radical democratic reforms antagonized conservatives like Cimon, but Pericles' flattery and manipulation triumphed.</li>
                <li><strong>War Incitement:</strong> Facing accusations of corruption and profligacy, Pericles started the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. to distract from his political woes. Sparta invaded Attica (Athenian territory), goaded by Athenian meddling in Corinth's affairs and Pericles' rhetoric of inevitable war. Pericles had already brought Attican Greeks within Athens' walls for defense.</li>
                <li><strong>Pericles' Strategy:</strong> A defensive strategy relying on Athens' rebuilt walls, superior navy, and refusal to overextend forces. He believed Athens would prevail due to individual creativity and freedom, unlike Sparta's regimentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Plague of Athens:</h3>
            <p>In the second year of the war (summer 430 B.C.), a terrible epidemic swept Athens, killing tens of thousands. Its exact nature is unknown, but it devastated morale, society, and government. Probably due to unsanitary, crowded conditions from the influx of Atticans, the epidemic raged for a couple of years, turning people against Pericles and the war, and ultimately claiming Pericles' life. Athens survived but was a shadow of its former self.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example of Demagoguery and Unintended Consequences:</strong><br>
                Pericles, facing accusations of corruption and profligacy, intentionally started the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. to divert attention from his domestic political troubles. This decision, driven by personal ambition and demagoguery, led to a devastating conflict that, combined with the unforeseen "Plague of Athens" (killing tens of thousands), ultimately weakened Athens significantly and contributed to its long decline.

        </summary>
        <div class="details-content">
            <p>The Peloponnesian War continued for two more decades, plagued by Athenian political instability and poor military judgment. A shaky peace was brokered in 421 B.C. but did not last. Another demagogue, <strong>Alcibiades</strong>, rose to prominence, seeking military adventurism to appease his ambition.</p>

            <h3>Alcibiades and Syracuse:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Syracuse Expedition:</strong> Alcibiades, seeking to distract from a political scandal, led a huge Athenian expeditionary force to Syracuse (a powerful Greek city-state in Sicily and Sparta's friend) after it attacked an Athenian ally.</li>
                <li><strong>Defections and Intrigue:</strong> When ordered to return for trial, Alcibiades defected to Sparta, encouraging them to aid Syracuse. After being beset by enemies in Sparta, he defected to Persia, manipulating them to weaken Sparta. He conspired with Athenian oligarchs for a coup to return to power.</li>
                <li><strong>Athenian Coups:</strong> An oligarchic "Four Hundred" was set up, then replaced by the "Five Thousand," eventually giving way to full democracy again.</li>
                <li><strong>Syracuse Defeat:</strong> Athenians suffered a terrible defeat at Syracuse, with most of their force wiped out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spartan Victory and Athenian Subjugation:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Lycurgus's Rise:</strong> A new Spartan leader, Lycurgus, skilled in naval and land warfare, assumed command in the war's final years.</li>
                <li><strong>Alcibiades' Fall:</strong> Lycurgus's naval victory over Alcibiades led to the latter's final fall from grace; he fled to Persia and was later killed by assassins (probably Spartan).</li>
                <li><strong>Battle of Aegospotami:</strong> Lycurgus wiped out the formidable Athenian navy at Aegospotami.</li>
                <li><strong>Athenian Surrender:</strong> Facing siege and starvation, Athens surrendered to Lycurgus in 404 B.C., after 27 years of fighting, ending the Athenian Golden Age.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Brief Athenian Resurgence and Final Decline:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li><strong>Spartan Magnanimity:</strong> Sparta, despite allies urging Athens' destruction, subjugated Athens under the "Thirty Tyrants," intending a political merger with the Spartan totalitarian state.</li>
                <li><strong>Spartan High-Handedness:</strong> Sparta reneged on promises to allies regarding spoils, leading to their uprising.</li>
                <li><strong>Athenian Independence:</strong> This weakened Sparta, allowing Athens to regain independence and reinstate democracy under Thrasybulus, though in an enfeebled state.</li>
                <li><strong>Corinthian War (395 B.C.):</strong> Athens, aided by former enemies Corinth and Thebes, fought Sparta again. Persia intervened, forcing terms, compelling Greeks to renounce alliances, and establishing Sparta as hegemon over Greece.</li>
                <li><strong>Theban Hegemony:</strong> Thebes, under Epaminondas, overthrew Spartan hegemony, culminating in the Battle of Leuctra (362 B.C.).</li>
                <li><strong>Macedonian Conquest:</strong> Thebes' prestige was short-lived. Phillip II of Macedon unified lower Greece (including Thebes and Athens, but excluding Sparta) under his empire. His son, Alexander the Great, completed the task, ending Greek democracy.</li>

            <h3>Parallels in History:</h3>
            <p>The Peloponnesian War and its aftermath offer many historical parallels, especially in the modern age, where individual liberty (e.g., in the United States) faces threats from the allure of Utopian democracy. Just as in ancient Athens, modern societies experience unchecked civil unrest, demagoguery, factional strife, and high-level conspiracies. If not controlled, these trends can fatally weaken Western and American liberties.</p>

                <strong>Historical Parallel - Autocratic Regimes:</strong><br>
                Autocratic regimes, from the Nazis to communist powers, have consistently been undermined by their inability to gain and keep allies. The old Soviet Union had only subjugated client states. Similarly, North Korea, like ancient Sparta, prides itself on insularity, a lack of friends, dedication to militarism, and a national ethos of self-sacrifice for the state's interest. This highlights a recurring weakness in highly centralized, repressive systems.

            <h3>Legacy of Athenian and Greek Democracy:</h3>
            <p>The fledgling Roman Republic adopted many features of Greek popular government (and some from Sparta), transmitting them to the modern age, where the idea of a people's government has taken root globally. The American Founders recognized that Athens' trial-and-error democracy was, in hindsight, mostly error. However, pioneers often take outrageous risks and commit grave errors in service of new ideals, leading to disaster for originators. Modern heirs, having improved upon their mistakes over millennia, owe them a debt of gratitude for their flawed enterprise.</p>
