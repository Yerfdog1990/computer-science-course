    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a thematic exploration, breaking down the Ancient Greek education system into five core sections: Overview, School Structure & Teachers, Male Education Journey, Female Education, and Beyond School. This structure allows the user to digest information logically, starting broad and then focusing on specific aspects like teacher roles and gender-based differences. Navigation is handled by a clear top bar, enabling users to jump to any section. Key interactions include clicking on teacher types to reveal detailed curricula and selecting age milestones on a timeline to understand male educational progression. This design prioritizes user understanding and ease of navigation, making complex historical information approachable and engaging. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: General access limitations (gender, class), purpose of education. Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: Textual summary with clear headings and paragraphs. Interaction: Static display. Justification: Best for conveying foundational context directly. Library/Method: HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: Three main teachers (grammatistes, kitharistes, paidotribes) and their curriculum. Goal: Organize, Inform. Viz/Method: Three interactive cards for each teacher. Interaction: Clicking a teacher's card updates a central text block with detailed information about their teaching responsibilities. Justification: Allows users to explore each role specifically without information overload. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for click events and content updates.
        - Report Info: Male educational path (age 7, 14-16, higher education for elite). Goal: Show Change/Process. Viz/Method: A horizontal timeline using HTML/CSS. Interaction: Clicking on an age marker reveals a description of that stage of a boy's education. Justification: Visually represents the progression through different educational phases. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for click events and content updates.
        - Report Info: Female education (domestic focus, no formal schooling). Goal: Inform, Compare. Viz/Method: Dedicated text section, potentially with bullet points comparing to male education implicitly. Interaction: Static display. Justification: Clearly outlines the contrast in educational opportunities. Library/Method: HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: Higher education (rhetoric, sophists) for elite. Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: Textual description. Interaction: Static display. Justification: Provides a complete picture of the educational spectrum for the elite. Library/Method: HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: Literacy rates (around a third literate). Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: Simple Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Static Chart. Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the limited access to literacy. Library/Method: Chart.js.

However, access to this transformative education was not universal.
