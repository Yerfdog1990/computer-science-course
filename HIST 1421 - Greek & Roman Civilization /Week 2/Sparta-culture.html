    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a thematic exploration, breaking down Spartan society into four core, interconnected pillars: Governance, Social Hierarchy, The Spartan Man, and The Spartan Woman. This structure allows the user to digest complex information in manageable, focused sections rather than a linear text dump. Navigation is handled by a clear top bar, allowing users to jump to any topic of interest. The key interaction is clicking on elements within each section to reveal detailed information. This is more intuitive than complex filters for this narrative content. The goal is to guide the user through a story, from the laws that governed Sparta to the lives of its people, making the societal structure and its implications clear and memorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Spartan Governance (Kings, Ephors, Gerousia). Goal: Organize. Viz/Method: Interactive diagram using HTML/CSS Flexbox. Interaction: Clicking on a component (e.g., 'Kings') reveals a detailed text block. Justification: A visual diagram clarifies the power structure more effectively than text alone. The interaction encourages exploration without overwhelming the user. Library: Vanilla JS for click events.
        - Report Info: Social classes (Spartiates, Mothakes, Perioikoi, Helots). Goal: Inform/Compare. Viz/Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js) and interactive cards. The chart visualizes the population imbalance, a key tension. Interaction: Clicking on chart segments or associated buttons filters the information cards displayed below. Justification: The chart provides immediate impact, showing the minority rule of the Spartiates. Cards allow for a direct comparison of rights and roles. Library: Chart.js for the visual, Vanilla JS for filtering.
        - Report Info: Male military training (agoge). Goal: Show Change/Process. Viz/Method: A horizontal timeline built with HTML/CSS. Interaction: Clicking on an age milestone on the timeline displays a description of that life stage. Justification: A timeline is the most intuitive way to represent a life journey, clearly showing the progression from birth to full citizenship. Library: Vanilla JS for click events.
        - Report Info: Status and life of Spartan women. Goal: Compare/Inform. Viz/Method: Side-by-side comparison cards (Spartan vs. other Greek women). Interaction: Simple, clear presentation of comparative facts. Justification: Direct comparison highlights the unique and elevated status of women in Sparta, which is a key takeaway from the source material. Library: N/A (static display).
