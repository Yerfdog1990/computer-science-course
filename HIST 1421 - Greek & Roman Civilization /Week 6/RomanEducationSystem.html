        <div class="details-content">
            <ul>
                <li>The Roman education system produced citizens, politicians, and generals well-equipped for challenges, contributing significantly to Roman success.</li>
                <li>Literacy rates in ancient Rome were notably higher than in surrounding non-Roman areas, impacting labor efficiency.</li>
                <li>By the Imperial Period, a formalized system had developed, forming the basis for modern Western education.</li>
                <li><strong>Extraordinary Continuity:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Methods, institutions, and curricula remained largely unchanged for six to seven centuries in Roman territory (and 1,000 years in Greek territory under Roman influence).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Government Intervention:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Central government intervention grew, primarily to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Remind municipalities of educational duties.</li>
                                <li>Fix teacher remuneration.</li>
                                <li>Supervise teacher selection.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Direct attention focused mainly on higher education.</li>
                        <li>**Emperor Theodosius II (425 CE)** created a higher education institute in Constantinople with 31 chairs (letters, rhetoric, philosophy, law).</li>
                        <li>Growth of bureaucracy favored technical education, specifically **stenography**.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evolution of Language Use (Greek and Latin):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Few Greeks learned Latin, even with growing administration and law schools.</li>
                        <li>In Latin territory, Greek use generally declined in late antiquity.</li>
                        <li>This "retrogression" also reflected the positive development of Latin culture itself, with Latin classics (Virgil, Cicero) gaining prominence over Greek authors (Homer, Demosthenes).</li>
                        <li>Led to specialists in intercultural relations and translations (Greek to Latin).</li>
                        <li>**4th-5th centuries CE:** Medical, veterinary, and philosophical education became possible in Latin through translations of Greek manuals.</li>
                        <li>**Boethius (c. 480–524 CE)** sought to make philosophy available in Latin, influencing medieval thought.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Christianity and Classical Education:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Christians integrated Classical instruction from existing schools, rather than creating a separate system.</li>
                        <li>Initially acknowledged dangers of Classical culture's pagan roots (e.g., teachers disqualified from baptism).</li>
                        <li>Recognized the utility of Classical culture, sending children to these schools even if barred from teaching.</li>
                        <li>Christian scholars (Tertullian, St. Basil the Great) sought to show how classics could be used beneficially despite promoting idolatry/immorality.</li>
                        <li>By 4th century, Christianity fully assimilated Classical education, with Christians holding teaching positions at all levels.</li>
                        <li>**St. Augustine's *De doctrina Christiana* (426 CE)** theorized this synthesis: Christianity required literacy (for Bible), rhetoric (for preaching), and philosophy (for theology).</li>
                        <li>The Church preserved literary culture for its clergy after "barbarian" invasions.</li>
                    </ul>
