      <div class="mt-4 text-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">This section introduces the fundamental concepts of mission, vision, and values within the planning process of an organization. It emphasizes how these elements contribute to defining an organization's purpose and guiding its strategic direction.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Key Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Understand the roles of mission, vision, and values in planning.</li>
          <li>Learn how mission and vision integrate into the Planning-Organizing-Leading-Controlling (P-O-L-C) framework.</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Mission and Vision in Planning</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The "P" in the P-O-L-C framework stands for "planning." Good plans are designed to achieve a specific "something," which is articulated in an organization’s mission and vision statements, representing its core purpose. These statements, along with specific goals and objectives, enable the crafting of a clear strategy for achievement. Mission and vision statements effectively communicate the organization’s values and purpose. The most impactful statements often include an emotional component, designed to inspire employees and delight customers.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">P-O-L-C Framework</h3>
        <p>The planning component of management principles includes (1) mission and vision, (2) strategy, and (3) goals and objectives, illustrating how these elements work together.</p>

      <summary class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 py-2">4.2: Case in Point: Xerox Motivates Employees for Success</summary>
      <div class="mt-4 text-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">This section presents a detailed case study of Xerox Corporation, illustrating how strong leadership and employee motivation, guided by core principles, were crucial in overcoming significant business challenges.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Xerox's Challenges and Turnaround</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">As of 2010, Xerox Corporation was a $22 billion multinational company with 130,000 employees operating in 160 countries. However, in 2000, Xerox faced imminent bankruptcy due to years of mismanagement, substantial debt, and questions about its accounting practices.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Leadership and Employee Motivation</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Anne Mulcahy, who joined Xerox in 1976 and became CEO in 2001, was instrumental in the company's turnaround. She recognized that a key problem was unmotivated employees, despite their inherent capabilities. Mulcahy believed that motivating employees by treating them as key stakeholders was crucial for achieving customer satisfaction and pulling the company back from the brink of failure. Her leadership not only steered Xerox through a difficult period but also resulted in a stronger, more focused company.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Succession and Continued Emphasis on People</h3>
        <p>In 2009, Ursula Burns, a lifetime Xerox employee who started as a graduate intern over 30 years prior, succeeded Anne Mulcahy as CEO. Burns became the first African American woman CEO to lead an S&P 100 company and the first woman to succeed another woman in this role. She emphasized the importance of teamwork and open communication, learned from her mentors at Xerox the value of managing individuals uniquely, and encouraged risk-taking among her teams by clearly communicating her intentions and priorities. This case highlights the strong correlation between a manager's leadership style and employee productivity and motivation, where employees feel a sense of importance and belonging to the company's success.</p>

    <!-- Section 4.3: The Roles of Mission, Vision, and Values -->
    <details class="mb-6 bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <summary class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-800 py-2">4.3: The Roles of Mission, Vision, and Values</summary>
      <div class="mt-4 text-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">This section defines mission and vision statements, emphasizing their distinct yet interconnected roles, and explains how values underpin both. It also details the three critical functions these statements serve within an organization.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Definitions</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> This communicates the organization's reason for being and how it serves its key stakeholders, such as customers, employees, investors, government, or communities (e.g., through social or environmental impact). Mission statements are often longer than vision statements and may include a summation of the firm’s core values. They answer "Who are we?" and "What does our organization value?"</li>
          <li><strong>Vision Statement:</strong> A forward-looking declaration of the organization's purpose and aspirations, typically brief and concise. It answers "Where is this organization going?" The strategy should directly flow from the vision, as it is intended to achieve the vision and fulfill the mission.</li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> These are the beliefs of an individual or group, in this context, the organization, in which they are emotionally invested. Organizations increasingly add a separate values statement to explicitly reaffirm their beliefs not always evident in the mission or vision statements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Examples:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Starbucks Mission Principles (incorporating values):</strong> These principles communicate the organization’s values by detailing how they: provide a great work environment with respect and dignity; embrace diversity; apply high standards to coffee purchasing, roasting, and delivery; develop enthusiastically satisfied customers; contribute positively to communities and the environment; and recognize profitability as essential for future success.</li>
          <li><strong>Starbucks Vision Statement:</strong> "Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world while maintaining our uncompromising principles as we grow." This brief statement clearly outlines their future aspiration.</li>
          <li><strong>Toyota Global Corporate Principles (incorporating values):</strong> Toyota’s principles reflect their commitment to honoring laws, respecting cultures, contributing to economic and social development, providing clean and safe products, developing advanced technologies, fostering creativity and teamwork, pursuing growth in harmony with the global community, and working with business partners for mutual benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Toyota Tag-line Vision:</strong> "moving forward" This concise phrase captures their forward-looking aspiration in most communications.</li>
          <li><strong>Wal-Mart's Tag-line Vision:</strong> "Save money. Live better." This tag line embodies their vision of providing value to customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Three Critical Roles of Mission and Vision:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Communicate Purpose to Stakeholders:</strong> Mission and vision statements serve as a vehicle for communicating the organization’s purpose and values to all key stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, suppliers, and government institutions. Widespread circulation and discussion ensure these statements are understood, shared, and internalized, helping employees better understand the strategy and its implementation.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Inform Strategy Development:</strong> They set a clear target for strategy development. A good strategy is defined by how well it helps the firm achieve its mission and vision. This relationship can be visualized as a funnel: the broad mission statement is distilled into the narrower vision statement, which then directly guides the explicit strategy. Vision statements should create "stretch and ambition," fostering a spirit of continuous innovation and improvement. For example, Toyota’s "moving forward" vision pushes managers to continuously seek environmentally friendly ways to improve their vehicles.</li>
          <li><strong>Develop Measurable Goals and Objectives:</strong> Mission and vision provide a high-level guide, while the strategy offers specific guidance, for establishing measurable goals and objectives. These objectives are used to gauge the success or failure of the strategy and the satisfaction of the broader mission objectives. For instance, Starbucks and Toyota would set profitability goals, alongside metrics for customer and employee satisfaction, and social and environmental responsibility.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 4.4: Mission and Vision in the P-O-L-C Framework -->
    <details class="mb-6 bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <summary class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-800 py-2">4.4: Mission and Vision in the P-O-L-C Framework</summary>
      <div class="mt-4 text-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">This section elaborates on how mission and vision statements extend beyond planning to influence organizing, leading, and controlling functions within an organization.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-3">Mission, Vision, and Organizing:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Organizing involves developing an organizational structure and allocating human resources to achieve objectives, including organization design, staffing, and organizational culture.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Organizational Design:</strong> This is a formal process for integrating people, information, and technology to align the organization’s form with its purpose. The design should reflect and support the strategy, which in turn is derived from the mission, vision, and values. Structure, administrative systems, and technology must all support the organization’s purpose.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Example (Pixar/Disney):</span> In 2006, Disney acquired Pixar, known for its creative animation. Pixar's strategy was to combine technology and talent to create computer-animated films with memorable characters and heartwarming stories. Disney supported this by making Pixar an independent division with significant decision-making leeway for its "creatives" (artists, writers, designers). Pixar also fostered sharing of work-in-progress up and down the hierarchy and conducted postmortems after each project to share innovations and learn from pitfalls, ensuring continuous improvement.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Organizational Culture:</strong> This is the workplace environment shaped by employee interactions, influenced by leaders, but contributed to by all employees' experiences and attributes. Aligning culture with mission and vision is powerful, but changing culture can be challenging and slow.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Example (Procter & Gamble):</span> In 2000, P&G aimed to change its vision to source more innovations externally, moving away from a long-standing "not invented here" (NIH) cultural bias that favored internal R&D. P&G gradually worked to combat this bias and open its culture to outside contributions, aligning it with their new vision.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Networks:</strong> Often referred to as the "invisible organization," these consist of individuals or organizations connected by interdependencies, like online communities (MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn). Networks offer three advantages: access to "private" information, diverse skill sets, and power.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Example (Disney/Pixar):</span> Disney fosters an open internal network within its Pixar division, encouraging members to share information and learn from each other. This allows, for instance, a cartoon designer to easily access a computer programmer to find innovative solutions. By promoting communication across hierarchical levels and empowering creatives, Pixar prevents power plays that could impede innovation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-3">Mission, Vision, and Leading:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Leading involves influencing others towards organizational objectives. Mission and vision are almost synonymous with leadership.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Visionary Leaders:</strong> Individuals like Steve Demos (White Wave/Silk soy milk), who had a personal mission to replace cow's milk with soy milk, and Walt Disney, who envisioned a theme park in a Florida swamp in the early 1960s, embody missions and visions that challenge the status quo. Such revolutionary visions require "real change leaders" to diffuse the philosophy throughout the organization.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Examples of Visionary Companies:</strong> Apple (Steve Jobs), Dell (Michael Dell), and Google (Sergey Brin and Larry Page) are examples where leaders focused on noble missions, enabling employees to achieve strategic breakthroughs and realize personal dreams.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Eight Principles of Visionary Leadership:</strong> Derived from Shiba’s "Four Practical Revolutions in Management":
            <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-2">
              <li>On-site observation for personal perception of societal value changes from an outsider's view.</li>
              <li>Persistence against resistance, using outside-in (customer/society-led) pressure with top-down instruction.</li>
              <li>Revolution starts with symbolic disruption of the old system through top-down efforts to create chaos.</li>
              <li>Direction is illustrated by a symbolically visible image and the leader’s symbolic behavior.</li>
              <li>Quickly establishing new physical, organizational, and behavioral systems is crucial.</li>
              <li>Real change leaders are necessary for revolution.</li>
              <li>Create an innovative system for feedback from results.</li>
              <li>Create a daily operation system, including new work structures and approaches to human capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Vision Pervading the Organization:</strong> When many employees understand and identify with the mission and vision, efficiency increases because frontline decisions align with organizational goals, requiring less supervision. This requires leaders to trust workers and provide opportunities for quality decision-making.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Example (Johnsonville Sausage):</span> CEO Ralph Stayer dramatically improved the company by sharing responsibility for the mission, vision, and strategy development with all employees. His vision was to be the most expensive sausage with the biggest market share. He decentralized decision-making and tied individual rewards to company-wide performance, empowering employees to make choices that realized the mission and vision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-3">Mission, Vision, and Controlling:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Controlling ensures performance aligns with standards through three steps: (1) establishing performance standards, (2) comparing actual performance against standards, and (3) taking corrective action.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Performance Standards:</strong> Mission and vision provide a general compass heading, and while ambiguous, they inform measurable objectives related to innovativeness, growth, or firm performance.
            <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-2">
              <li><strong>Leading Indicators:</strong> Predict future performance.
                <br><span class="font-semibold">Example:</span> General Electric asks customers if they will refer new business; this measure of customer satisfaction predicts future sales.</li>
              <li><strong>Pacing Indicators:</strong> Show real-time progress.
                <br><span class="font-semibold">Example:</span> On-time deliveries or machinery operational status.</li>
              <li><strong>Lagging Indicators:</strong> Historical performance.
                <br><span class="font-semibold">Example:</span> Financial performance, such as profits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2">Firms increasingly use dashboards or Balanced Scorecards with a mix of these indicators.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Actual Versus Desired Performance:</strong> Goals and objectives derived from mission and vision provide feedback for assessing performance, identifying success, and determining where corrective action is needed. Specific and measurable goals enable managers to take corrective action before significant damage occurs.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Corrective Action:</strong> Mission and vision signal the need for corrective action when performance deviates negatively from objectives, though the specific actions are determined by the strategy.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM):</strong> SHRM integrates an organization’s human capital (its people) into the mission and vision. This means aligning decisions about people with the organization’s desired results. Organizations successfully align SHRM by integrating it into the planning process, emphasizing HR activities that support mission goals, and building strong HR/management capabilities and relationships.</li>

      <summary class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-800 py-2">4.5: Creativity and Passion</summary>
      <div class="mt-4 text-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">This section delves into how creativity and passion are integral to developing unique and motivating mission and vision statements, and how they drive innovation and engagement.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Definitions:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> The power or ability to invent. In business, it is the essence of innovation and progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Passion:</strong> An intense, driving feeling or conviction, often associated with emotion that compels action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Relevance to Mission and Vision:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Vision statements should be novel and unique, which are products of creativity and passion, challenging the status quo and informing stakeholders to move the organization forward. Creativity and passion also influence the organization’s mission, as mission statements express values and deeply held beliefs.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Four Types of Creativity (DeGraf and Lawrence):</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">This typology helps managers understand and foster creativity.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Investment (External, High Control):</strong> Associated with speed and competitiveness, driven by the desire to be first and fast.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Practical Example:</span> The "beer wars" between SABMiller and Anheuser Busch (Budweiser) illustrate this. Miller aggressively attacked AB's quality through advertisements and launched numerous new products to gain market share, demonstrating a competitive, rapid approach to innovation.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Imagination (External, Flexibility):</strong> Characterized by new ideas and breakthroughs, often linked to the drive or genius of an individual.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Practical Example:</span> Apple's innovative designs for Macintosh computers, followed by game-changing breakthroughs like the iPod and iPhone, are prime examples of imagination creativity, often attributed to Steve Jobs' vision.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Improvement (Internal, High Control):</strong> Involves making existing ideas better and more efficient.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Practical Examples:</span> Ray Kroc, McDonald’s founder, implemented quality and cooking standards for consistent burgers and fries, giving McDonald’s a significant advantage through process-oriented improvement. Similarly, Toyota used the refinement of its automaking processes (Toyota Business System) to become a global leader in high-quality car manufacturing.</li>
          <li><strong>Incubation (Internal, Flexibility):</strong> A deliberate approach focused on sustainability and leaving a legacy, involving teamwork, empowerment, and collective action.
            <br><span class="font-semibold">Practical Example:</span> Mahatma Gandhi's ability to single-handedly stop a war by mobilizing networks of people to pursue a common goal exemplifies incubation creativity, demonstrating how collective action can lead to sustainable, transformative change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Passion and Employee Engagement:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Engaged Employees:</strong> These are employees who are committed, passionate, proud, and energized by their work, aligning their efforts with the organization's mission and goals. They are performing at the top of their abilities and are happy about it.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Impact of Engagement:</strong> Gallup statistics from 300,000 companies suggest that if 100% of employees were fully engaged, organizations could see a 70% increase in customer loyalty, a 70% decrease in turnover, and a 40% jump in profits.</li>
          <li>Despite these benefits, studies show that only a small percentage of employees (20%) feel very passionate about their jobs, and even fewer (less than 15%) feel strongly energized by their work. Only 31% believe their employer inspires their best. Consciously creating an environment where passion is encouraged through mission and vision offers a significant competitive advantage.</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Stakeholders and Stakeholder Analysis:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Stakeholders Defined:</strong> Individuals or groups who have an interest in an organization’s ability to deliver intended results and maintain the viability of its products and services. This includes a broad range of parties who can influence or be influenced by the firm's strategy.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Importance:</strong> Managers must consider stakeholders' interests, needs, and preferences, as these can significantly impact strategy execution and the realization of mission and vision. Identifying critical stakeholders, understanding their short- and long-term interests, assessing their potential influence, and considering the firm’s impact on them (beneficially or adversely) are crucial steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Stakeholder Analysis:</strong> This refers to techniques or tools used to identify and understand the needs and expectations of major interests inside and outside the organization. It helps managers clarify the organization’s purpose and meet stakeholders' needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Identifying Stakeholders:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The first step is to identify major stakeholder groups who will be affected by or affect the firm’s strategy and its execution. These can range from employees, customers, suppliers, and investors to competitors, government bodies, and communities.</p>

        <p>When performed well, the resulting strategy has a higher chance of success because those relied upon for implementation were involved from the formulation stage. This enables engagement of various stakeholders across all P-O-L-C stages, from planning to controlling. Stakeholder evaluation of both quantitative (e.g., stock price, sales, profits) and qualitative (e.g., customer service, employee satisfaction) outcomes determines management effectiveness, though different stakeholders prioritize different outcomes.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Learn about the basics of the mission and vision development process.</li>
          <li>Understand the content of good mission and vision statements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Communicating and Monitoring Mission and Vision</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">At this point, you have an understanding of what a mission and vision statement is and how creativity, passion, and stakeholder interests might be accounted for. The actual step-by-step process of developing a mission and vision might start with the mission and vision statements, but you should think of this process more broadly in terms of multiple steps: (1) the process, (2) the content of the mission and vision statements, (3) communicating mission and vision to all relevant stakeholders, and (4) monitoring. As shown in “Process, Content, Application, and Monitoring in Mission and Vision Development,” Information Week contributor Sourabh Hajela breaks out one way you might manage your mission/vision development checklist. Let’s dive in to the development process first.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Mission and vision statements are statements of an organization’s purpose and potential; what you want the organization to become. Both statements should be meaningful to you and your organization. It should be shared with all of the employees in the organization to create a unified direction for everyone to move in.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Process, Content, Application, and Monitoring in Mission and Vision Development (Checklist)</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Let the business drive the mission and vision.</li>
          <li>Involve all stakeholders in its development; otherwise, they won’t consider it theirs.</li>
          <li>Assign responsibility so that it’s clear how each person, including each stakeholder, can contribute.</li>
          <li>Seek expert facilitation to reach a vision supported by all.</li>
          <li>Revise and reiterate; you’ll likely go through multiple iterations before you’re satisfied.</li>
          <li>Start from where you are to get to where you want to go.</li>
          <li>Build in the values of the organization: Every organization has a soul. Tap into yours, and adjust as needed. Mission and vision built on your values will not just hold promise but also deliver on it.</li>
          <li>Build on the core competencies of the organization: A mission and vision are useless if they can’t be put into operation. This requires recognition of your organization’s strengths and weaknesses.</li>
          <li>Factor in your style: A mission and vision must reflect the leader’s style. You can’t sustain action that goes against it.</li>
          <li>Make it visual: A picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
          <li>Make it simple to understand: Complex language and disconnected statements have little impact—people can’t implement what they don’t understand.</li>
          <li>Make it achievable: A mission and vision are an organization’s dreams for the future. Unachievable goals discourage people.</li>
          <li>Phase it in: Reach for the sky—in stages.</li>
          <li>Make it actionable: If it’s too abstract, no one knows what to do next.</li>
          <li>Communicate often: Internal communications are the key to success. People need to see the mission and vision, identify with them, and know that leadership is serious about it.</li>
          <li>Create messages that relate to the audience: To adopt a mission and vision, people must see how they can achieve it, and what’s in it for them.</li>
          <li>Create messages that inspire action: It’s not what you say, but how you say it.</li>
          <li>Use it: Beyond printing it, posting it, and preaching it, you also need to practice what is laid out in the mission and vision…“walk the talk”</li>
          <li>Live it: Management must lead by example.</li>
          <li>Be real: It’s better to adjust the mission statement as needed than to not live up to the standards it sets.</li>
          <li>Identify key milestones: While traveling to your destination, acknowledge the milestones along the way.</li>
          <li>Monitor your progress: A strategic audit, combined with key metrics, can be used to measure progress against goals and objectives.</li>
          <li>Use external audit team: An external team brings objectivity, plus a fresh perspective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Mission and Vision-Development Process</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Mission and vision development are analogous to the “P” (planning) in the P-O-L-C framework. Start with the people. To the greatest extent possible, let those people responsible for executing the mission and vision drive their development. Sometimes this means soliciting their input and guiding them through the development of the actual statements, but ideally, it means teaching them how to craft those statements themselves. Involve as many key stakeholders as possible in its development; otherwise, they won’t consider it theirs. Assign responsibility so that it’s clear how each person, including each stakeholder, can contribute.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Content</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The content of the mission and vision statements are analogous to the O (organizing) part of the P-O-L-C framework. Begin by describing the best possible business future for your company, using a target of 5 to 10 years in the future. Your written goals should be dreams, but they should be achievable dreams. Jim Collins (author of <em>Good to Great</em>) suggests that the vision be very bold, or what he likes to call a BHAG—a big, hairy, audacious goal—like the United State’s goal in the 1960s to go to the moon by the end of the decade, or Martin Luther King’s vision for a nonracist America.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Recognizing that the vision statement is derived from aspects of the mission statement, it is helpful to start there. Richard O’ Hallaron and his son, David R. O’ Hallaron, in <em>The Mission Primer: Four Steps to an Effective Mission Statement</em>, suggest that you consider a range of objectives, both financial and nonfinancial. Specifically, the O’Hallarons find that the best mission statements have given attention to the following six areas:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>What “want-satisfying” service or commodity do we produce and work constantly to improve?</li>
          <li>How do we increase the wealth or quality of life or society?</li>
          <li>How do we provide opportunities for the productive employment of people?</li>
          <li>How are we creating a high-quality and meaningful work experience for employees?</li>
          <li>How do we live up to the obligation to provide fair and just wages?</li>
          <li>How do we fulfill the obligation to provide a fair and just return on capital?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">When writing your statements, use the present tense, speaking as if your business has already become what you are describing. Use descriptive statements describing what the business looks like, feels like, using words that describe all of a person’s senses. Your words will be a clear written motivation for where your business organization is headed. Mission statements, because they cover more ground, tend to be longer than vision statements, but you should aim to write no more than a page. Your words can be as long as you would like them to be, but a shorter vision statement may be easier to remember.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Communications</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The communications step of the mission and vision statements development process is analogous to the “L” (leading) part of the P-O-L-C framework. Communicate often: Internal communications are the key to success. People need to see the vision, identify with it, and know that leadership is serious about it.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Managers must evaluate both the need and the necessary tactics for persuasively communicating a strategy in four different directions: <strong>upward</strong>, <strong>downward</strong>, <strong>across</strong>, and <strong>outward</strong>.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Communicating Upward:</strong> Increasingly, firms rely on bottom-up innovation processes that encourage and empower middle-level and division managers to take ownership of mission and vision and propose new strategies to achieve them. Communicating upward means that someone or some group has championed the vision internally and has succeeded in convincing top management of its merits and feasibility.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Communicating Downward:</strong> Communicating downward means enlisting the support of the people who’ll be needed to implement the mission and vision. Too often, managers undertake this task only after a strategy has been set in stone, thereby running the risk of undermining both the strategy and any culture of trust and cooperation that may have existed previously. Starting on the communication process early is the best way to identify and surmount obstacles, and it usually ensures that a management team is working with a common purpose and intensity that will be important when it’s time to implement the strategy.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicating Across and Outward:</strong> The need to communicate across and outward reflects the fact that realization of a mission and vision will probably require cooperation from other units of the firm (across) and from key external stakeholders, such as material and capital providers, complementors, and customers (outward). Internally, for example, the strategy may call for raw materials or services to be provided by another subsidiary; perhaps it depends on sales leads from other units. The software company Emageon couldn’t get hospitals to adopt the leading-edge visualization software that was produced and sold by one subsidiary until its hardware division started cross-selling the software as well. This internal coordination required a champion from the software side to convince managers on the hardware side of the need and benefits of working together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Application</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">It is the successful execution of this step—actually using the mission and vision statements—that eludes most organizations. “Yes, it is inconvenient and expensive to move beyond the easy path” and make decisions that support the mission statement, says Lila Booth, a Philadelphia-area consultant who is on the faculty of the Wharton Small Business Development Center. But ditching mission for expediency “is short-term thinking,” she adds, “which can be costly in the end, costly enough to put a company out of business.” That is not to say that a mission statement is written in stone. Booth cites her own consulting business. It began well before merger mania but has evolved with the times and now is dedicated in significant part to helping merged companies create common cultures. “Today, our original mission statement would be very limiting,” she says.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Even the most enthusiastic proponents acknowledge that mission statements are often viewed cynically by organizations and their constituents. That is usually due to large and obvious gaps between a company’s words and deeds. “Are there companies that have managers who do the opposite of what their missions statements dictate? Of course,” says Geoffrey Abrahams, author of <em>The Mission Statement Book</em>. “Mission statements are tools, and tools can be used or abused or ignored.…Management must lead by example. It’s the only way employees can live up to the company’s mission statement.” Ultimately, if you are not committed to using the mission statement then you are best advised not to create one.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Monitoring</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The monitoring step of the mission and vision statements development process is analogous to the “C” (controlling) part of the P-O-L-C framework. Identify key milestones that are implied or explicit in the mission and vision. Since mission and vision act like a compass for a long trip to a new land, as <em>Information Week’s</em> Hajela suggests, “while traveling to your destination, acknowledge the milestones along the way. With these milestones you can monitor your progress: A strategic audit, combined with key metrics, can be used to measure progress against goals and objectives. To keep the process moving, try using an external audit team. One benefit is that an external team brings objectivity, plus a fresh perspective.” It also helps motivate your team to stay on track.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">This section described some of the basic inputs into crafting mission and vision statements. It explored how mission and vision involved initiation, determination of content, communication, application, and then monitoring to be sure if and how the mission and vision were being followed and realized. In many ways, you learned how the development of mission and vision mirrors the P-O-L-C framework itself—from planning to control (monitoring).</p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Determine what mission and vision mean for you.</li>
          <li>Develop some guidelines for developing your mission and vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">Mission and vision are concepts that can be applied to you, personally, well beyond their broader relevance to the P-O-L-C framework. Personal mission and vision communicate the direction in which you are headed, as well as providing some explanation for why you are choosing one direction or set of objectives over others. Thinking about and writing down mission and vision statements for your life can help provide you with a compass as you work toward your own goals and objectives.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Your Mission and Vision</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Note that the development of a personal mission and vision, and then a strategy for achieving them, are exactly the opposite of what most people follow. Most people do not plan further ahead than their next job or activity (if they plan their career at all). They take a job because it looks attractive, and then they see what they can do with it. We advocate looking as far into the future as you can and deciding where you want to end up and what steps will lead you there. In that way, your life and your career fit into some intelligent plan, and you are in control of your own life.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Guidelines</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The first step in planning a career is obviously a long-term goal. Where do you want to end up, ultimately? Do you really want to be a CEO or president of the United States, now that you know what it costs to be either one? There are a couple basic parts to this process.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>BHAG:</strong> First, set out a bold vision—Jim Collins, author of <em>Good to Great</em>, describes this as a BHAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal).
            <br>Five guiding criteria for good BHAGs is that they:
            <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-2">
              <li>Are set with understanding, not bravado.</li>
              <li>Fit squarely in the three circles of (a) what you are deeply passionate about (including your core values and purpose), (b) what drives your economic logic, and (c) what differentiates you (what you can be the best in the world at).</li>
              <li>Have a long time frame—10 to 30 years.</li>
              <li>Are clear, compelling, and easy to grasp.</li>
              <li>Directly reflect your core values and core purpose.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Values:</strong> Second, sketch out your personal values, or “Guiding Philosophy”—a set of core values and principles like your own Declaration of Independence.</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Once the vision is set, you have to develop some long-term goal (or goals), then intermediate-term goals, and so on. If you want to be President, what jobs will you have to take first to get there and when do you have to get these jobs? Where should you live? What training do you need? What political connections do you need? Then you have to set up an orderly plan for obtaining the connections and training that you need and getting into these steppingstone jobs.
            <br>Finally, you need to establish short-term goals to fit clearly into a coherent plan for your entire career. Your next job (if you are now a fairly young person) should be picked not only for its salary or for its opportunities for advancement but for its chances to provide you with the training and connections you need to reach your long-term goals. The job that is superficially attractive to you because it has a high salary, offers the opportunity for immediate advancement, or is located in a desirable place may be a mistake from the standpoint of your long-term career.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Five Steps</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Former business school professor, entrepreneur (founder of www.quintcareers.com), and colleague Randall S. Hansen, PhD, has done a masterful job of assembling resources that aim to help your career, including an excellent five-step plan for creating personal mission statements. With his generous permission, he has allowed us to reproduce his five-step plan—adapted by us to encompass both mission and vision—in this section.</p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">The Five-Step Plan</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">A large percentage of companies, including most of the Fortune 500, have corporate mission and vision statements. Mission and vision statements are designed to provide direction and thrust to an organization, an enduring statement of purpose. A mission and vision statement act as an invisible hand that guides the people in the organization. A mission and vision statement explains the organization’s reason for being and answers the question, “What business are we in?”</p>
        <p class="mb-4">A personal mission and vision statement is a bit different from a company mission statement, but the fundamental principles are the same. Writing a personal mission and vision statement offers the opportunity to establish what’s important and perhaps make a decision to stick to it before we even start a career. Or it enables us to chart a new course when we’re at a career crossroads. Steven Covey (in <em>First Things First</em>) refers to developing a mission and vision statement as “connecting with your own unique purpose and the profound satisfaction that comes from fulfilling it.”</p>
        <p class="mb-4">A personal mission and vision statement helps job seekers identify their core values and beliefs. Michael Goodman (in <em>The Potato Chip Difference: How to Apply Leading Edge Marketing Strategies to Landing the Job You Want</em>) states that a personal mission statement is “an articulation of what you’re all about and what success looks like to you.” A personal mission and vision statement also allows job seekers to identify companies that have similar values and beliefs and helps them better assess the costs and benefits of any new career opportunity.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The biggest problem most job seekers face is not in wanting to have a personal mission and vision statement but actually writing it. So, to help you get started on your personal mission and vision statement, here is a five-step mission/vision-building process. Take as much time on each step as you need, and remember to dig deeply to develop a mission and vision statement that is both authentic and honest. To help you better see the process, Professor Hansen included an example of one friend’s process in developing her mission and vision statements.</p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">Step-by-Step Plan for Creating Personal Mission/Vision Statements:</h4>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Step 1: Identify Past Successes.</strong> Spend some time identifying four or five examples where you have had personal success in recent years. These successes could be at work, in your community, or at home. Write them down. Try to identify whether there is a common theme—or themes—to these examples. Write them down.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Step 2: Identify Core Values.</strong> Develop a list of attributes that you believe identify who you are and what your priorities are. The list can be as long as you need. Once your list is complete, see whether you can narrow your values to five or six most important values. Finally, see whether you can choose the one value that is most important to you. We’ve added “Generating Ideas for Your Mission and Vision” to help jog your memory and brainstorm about what you do well and really like to do.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Step 3: Identify Contributions.</strong> Make a list of the ways you could make a difference. In an ideal situation, how could you contribute best to:
            <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-1">
              <li>the world in general</li>
              <li>your family</li>
              <li>your employer or future employers</li>
              <li>your friends</li>
              <li>your community</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-700 mb-2">Generating Ideas for Your Mission and Vision</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">A useful mission and vision statement should include two pieces: what you wish to accomplish and contribute and who you want to be, the character strengths and qualities you wish to develop. While this sounds simple, those pieces of information are not always obvious. Try these tools for generating valuable information about yourself.</p>
        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Part I</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">Describe your ideal day. This is not about being practical. It is designed to include as many sides of you and your enthusiasms as possible: creative, competent, artistic, introverted, extraverted, athletic, playful, nurturing, contemplative, and so on.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Imagine yourself 132 years old and surrounded by your descendants or those descendants of your friends. You are in a warm and relaxed atmosphere (such as around a fireplace). What would you say to them about what is important in life? This exercise is designed to access the values and principles that guide your life.</li>
          <li>Imagine that it is your 70th birthday (or another milestone in your life). You have been asked by national print media to write a press release about your achievements. Consider what you would want your family, friends, coworkers in your profession and in your community to say about you. What difference would you like to have made in their lives? How do you want to be remembered? This is designed to inventory your actions and accomplishments in all areas of your life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Part II</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Review your notes for these three exercises. With those responses in mind, reflect on questions 1, 2, and 3 above. Then write a rough draft (a page of any length) of your mission statement. Remember that it should describe what you want to do and who you want to be. This is not a job description. Carry it with you, post copies in visible places at home and work, and revise and evaluate. Be patient with yourself. The process is as important as the outcome. After a few weeks, write another draft. Ask yourself whether your statement was based on proven principles that you believe in, if you feel direction, motivation, and inspiration when you read it. Over time, reviewing and evaluating will keep you abreast of your own development.</p>

        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4" start="4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Step 4: Identify Goals.</strong> Spend some time thinking about your priorities in life and the goals you have for yourself. Make a list of your personal goals, perhaps in the short term (up to three years) and the long term (beyond three years).</li>
          <li><strong>Step 5: Write Mission and Vision Statements.</strong> On the basis of the first four steps and a better understanding of yourself, begin writing your personal mission and vision statements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Final Thoughts:</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">A personal mission and vision statement is, of course, personal. But if you want to see whether you have been honest in developing your personal mission and vision statement, we suggest sharing the results of this process with one or more people who are close to you. Ask for their feedback. Finally, remember that mission and vision statements are not meant to be written once and blasted into stone. You should set aside some time annually to review your career, job, goals, and mission and vision statements—and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In this section, you learned how to think of mission and vision in terms of your personal circumstances, whether it is your career or other aspects of your life. Just as you might do in developing an organization’s vision statement, you were encouraged to think of a big, hairy audacious goal as a starting point. You also learned a five-step process for developing a personal vision statement.</p>
